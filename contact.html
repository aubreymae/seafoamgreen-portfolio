	I'm Aubrey Garcia and I love all things illustration and design. Growing up immersed in animation, video game, and technology, my work has become a mix of traditional and digital art. Drawing and design is where my heart lies.

	User interfaces is a prominent field that I love to contribute to. With years of experience with front-end development and object-oriented programming with Java, I've created applications ranging from mobile phone apps, WordPress websites, and plain static sites (my favourite!). You might be asking yourself, why UIs when you love drawing so much, Aubrey? I find that it is the perfect combination of design and technology. The feeling of making a good looking website is something unique.
